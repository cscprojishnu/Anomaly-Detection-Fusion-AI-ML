## üß† Overview

Anomaly detection in Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data is critical to maintaining stability and security in modern power grids. This project introduces a **hybrid anomaly detection framework** that combines:

- **Isolation Forest (IF)** for statistical anomaly detection
- **LSTM Autoencoder** for temporal anomaly detection

These techniques are fused using a weighted strategy to improve detection accuracy, particularly in the presence of missing data, noise, or cyber-induced anomalies.
